<h1> Story Title: Nature Vs pollution, Why? </h1>
        <p> We decided to do this because we wanted to represent this abrupt natural urgency which is pollution in a cartoon, fictional, action, way as it would be enjoyable and easy to understand for most audiences. </p>
        <h2> The story: </h2>
        <p>
        It starts with the embodiments of nature and pollution and then they eventually fight but pollution has the power to wither away all living things but towards the end nature realizes he has the same power and ends up using it on pollution and reverting all damage caused by it
        </p>
        <h3> Our characters And set: </h3>
        <p> Nature is the protagonist and Pollution is the antagonist. Their designs are very nice, Nature is in form of a tree with branches and Pollution is more of like a dark villian design which fits how polution is bad for nature. The set was a basic landscape of trees and a beautiful view except at the far end it's being contaminated it's burnt because of Pollution. </p> 
        <h4> Program used: </h4>
            <p> We used dragonframe. It was very easy to use and very useful when it came to recording the whole stop motion. We had very little knowledge but we recorded succesfully.
